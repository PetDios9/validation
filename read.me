In this project, i created a form validation sheet that checks each field to ensure they are filled in with very simple requirements through javascript.
Upon successful entries and the form submitting successfully, the user will recieve a window alert congradulating them.
If a field is filled in incorrectly or left blank, the form will show the error and what the client must do in order to submit the form.
Overall i am happy with the overall functionality of the form, but i do intend on going back into the js file to clean the code up and increase readability with less if statments. I also intend on styling the form a bit better.
